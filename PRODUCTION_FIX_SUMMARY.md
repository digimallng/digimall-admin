# Production Login Issue - Fixed

## Issue Summary

The admin dashboard was failing to load in production with the following errors:

```
Middleware setup check failed: Error: fetch failed
Setup required, redirecting to /setup from middleware
```

**Root Cause**: The middleware was attempting to make fetch calls in Next.js Edge Runtime, which fails in production Docker environments.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Modified Middleware (`src/middleware.ts`)

**Before**: Middleware made HTTP fetch calls to check setup status
```typescript
// ❌ This was failing in production
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:4300/api/setup/check');
```

**After**: Middleware uses environment variables (no fetch calls)
```typescript
// ✅ Now uses environment variables
function isSetupRequired(): boolean {
  if (process.env.SETUP_COMPLETED === 'true') {
    return false;
  }
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
    return process.env.SETUP_REQUIRED === 'true';
  }
  return false;
}
```

### 2. Updated Docker Compose (`docker-compose.prod.yml`)

Added `SETUP_COMPLETED=true` to environment variables:

```yaml
environment:
  - NODE_ENV=production
  - PORT=4300
  - SETUP_COMPLETED=true  # ← Added this
```

## What Your Pipeline Needs

### Environment Variables

Ensure your pipeline/deployment environment has:

```bash
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=4300
SETUP_COMPLETED=true
```

If you're using a `.env.admin` file on the server, add:
```
SETUP_COMPLETED=true
```

### No Code Changes Needed After This

Once you commit and push these changes, your pipeline will:
1. Build the new image with the fixed middleware
2. Deploy with the updated docker-compose configuration
3. The app will work correctly without the fetch errors

## Files Changed

1. ✅ `src/middleware.ts` - Removed fetch calls, added env var checks
2. ✅ `docker-compose.prod.yml` - Added SETUP_COMPLETED=true
3. ✅ `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Fixed React Hooks order issue

## Verification After Deployment

Once your pipeline deploys, verify:

1. **No more middleware errors**:
   ```bash
   docker logs digimall-admin | grep "fetch failed"
   # Should return nothing
   ```

2. **Login page loads**: Visit `https://admin.digimall.ng/auth/login`

3. **Can authenticate**: Log in with your admin credentials

## Why This Fix Works

- **No Edge Runtime limitations**: Environment variables work in Edge Runtime
- **No network dependencies**: Instant checks without fetch calls
- **Docker-friendly**: Doesn't rely on localhost networking in containers
- **Pipeline-compatible**: Environment variables are set during deployment

## Next Steps

1. Commit these changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "fix: resolve middleware fetch failures in production"
   git push
   ```

2. Your pipeline will automatically build and deploy

3. The admin dashboard will be accessible at `https://admin.digimall.ng`

## Important Notes

- The `/api/setup/check` route still works for client-side checks
- No changes needed to your pipeline configuration
- The fix is backward compatible with existing deployments
- If you ever need to force setup mode, set `SETUP_REQUIRED=true`
