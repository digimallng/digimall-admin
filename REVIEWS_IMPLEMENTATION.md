## API Integration Notes

### Backend Requirements
The implementation assumes the backend follows the API specification in `ADMIN_API_DOCUMENTATION.md`:

1. **Base URL:** `/admin/reviews`
2. **Authentication:** Bearer token in Authorization header
3. **Response Format:** Consistent JSON structure with `success`, `data`, `message` fields
4. **Pagination:** Standard `page`, `limit`, `total`, `pages` structure
5. **Error Handling:** HTTP status codes with error messages

### Expected Backend Behavior
- **Auto-approval:** 4-5 star reviews auto-approved
- **Rating Sync:** Product ratings recalculated after moderation
- **Soft Deletes:** Reviews marked as deleted (or hard delete if specified)
- **Audit Trail:** All moderation actions logged with admin info
- **Timestamps:** Proper ISO date strings for all dates
