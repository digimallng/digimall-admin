# Settings & Port Migration Cleanup Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the changes made to migrate from microservices architecture to unified backend, including settings page updates and port reference cleanup.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Platform Configuration Integration
**Changed:** Updated `getPlatformConfig()` and `updatePlatformConfig()` methods in `settings.service.ts`
- **Before:** Used multiple fallbacks including system service and mock data
- **After:** Direct integration with `/system/config` endpoints only
- **Rationale:** The admin service provides these endpoints, so fallbacks to mock data were unnecessary

### 2. Fixed System Notifications Integration  
**Changed:** Updated notification management in `settings.service.ts`
- **Before:** Tried multiple endpoints including non-existent `/notification-management/system-notifications`
- **After:** Uses `/notification-management` endpoint correctly
- **Rationale:** Aligned with actual admin service notification management controller

### 3. Fixed Notification Services Status
**Changed:** Updated `getNotificationServices()` method
- **Before:** Used complex fallback logic with mock data generation
- **After:** Direct call to `/system/status` endpoint only
- **Rationale:** Real system status provides accurate service health data

### 4. Removed Backup Functionality
**What was removed:**
- `useBackupSystem()` hook from `use-settings.ts`
- `useBackupStatus()` hook from `use-settings.ts`
- `backups` query key from settings keys
- All backup-related types and interfaces

**Rationale:** No corresponding admin service endpoints exist for backup functionality. The hooks only contained mock implementations.

### 5. Removed Export Config Button
**What was removed:**
- Export Config button from settings page header actions
- `Download` icon import (no longer used)

**Rationale:** No backend implementation exists for exporting configuration. Button was non-functional.

### 6. Removed Test/Restart Notification Services
**What was removed:**
- `useTestNotificationService()` hook
- `useRestartNotificationService()` hook  
- `testNotificationService()` method in settings service
- `restartNotificationService()` method in settings service

**Rationale:** Admin service does not provide endpoints for testing or restarting individual notification services.

### 7. Removed Mock Data Methods
**What was removed:**
- `generateNotificationServicesStatus()` method
- `getDefaultPlatformConfig()` method

**Rationale:** These methods generated mock/fallback data which is no longer needed since we're using real endpoints exclusively.

### 8. Updated Maintenance Mode Integration
**Changed:** Updated maintenance mode methods
- **Before:** Delegated to system service with complex data transformation
- **After:** Direct calls to `/system/maintenance` endpoint
- **Rationale:** Simplified to use actual admin service endpoints

## Benefits of These Changes

1. **Improved Reliability:** Settings page now uses real data from admin service instead of mock data
2. **Better Error Handling:** Clear error states when endpoints are unavailable instead of silent fallbacks
3. **Reduced Complexity:** Removed unnecessary fallback logic and mock data generation
4. **User Experience:** Removed non-functional buttons that could confuse administrators
5. **Maintenance:** Easier to maintain code that directly reflects backend capabilities

## Current Functional Features

### Working Settings Features:
- ✅ Platform configuration management (get/update via `/system/config`)
- ✅ System status monitoring (via `/system/status` and `/system/metrics`)
- ✅ Maintenance mode toggle (via `/system/maintenance`)
- ✅ Notification services status display (from system status)
- ✅ System notifications management (via `/notification-management`)

### Removed/Non-functional Features:
- ❌ Configuration export 
- ❌ System backup management
- ❌ Individual notification service testing
- ❌ Individual notification service restart

## Impact on Users

Users will now see:
- More accurate system status information
- Cleaner interface without non-functional buttons  
- Better error messaging when services are unavailable
- Faster loading since mock data generation is removed

## Future Considerations

If the following features are needed, backend endpoints would need to be implemented first:
1. Configuration export functionality
2. System backup management
3. Individual notification service control (test/restart)

These features were removed because they had no backend support, but could be re-added if the admin service implements the necessary endpoints.

## Port Migration (Microservices → Unified Backend)

### Files Updated for Port Migration

All references to old microservice ports have been updated to use the unified backend at port 3000:

#### 1. **Setup Routes**
- **`src/app/api/setup/super-admin/route.ts`**
  - Old: `http://localhost:4800/api/v1/setup/create-super-admin`
  - New: `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/staff/setup/create-super-admin`

- **`src/app/api/setup/check/route.ts`**
  - Old: `http://localhost:4800/api/v1/setup/verify-setup`
  - New: `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/staff/setup/verify-setup`

#### 2. **Test & Proxy Routes**
- **`src/app/api/test-proxy/route.ts`**
  - Old: Tested chat (3005) and admin (4800) services
  - New: Tests unified backend only at port 3000

#### 3. **Media Upload**
- **`src/app/api/media/upload/route.ts`**
  - Old: `http://localhost:4800`
  - New: `http://localhost:3000`

#### 4. **WebSocket Provider**
- **`src/providers/admin-websocket-provider.tsx`**
  - Old: `http://localhost:4800`
  - New: `http://localhost:3000`

#### 5. **Setup Page Backup**
- **`src/app/setup/page-original.tsx`**
  - Old: `http://localhost:4800/api/v1`
  - New: `http://localhost:3000/api/v1`

### Port Migration Summary

| Old Port | Service | New Port | Backend |
|----------|---------|----------|---------|
| 4800 | Admin Service | 3000 | Unified Backend |
| 4700 | Chat Service | 3000 | Unified Backend |
| 4300 | User Service | 3000 | Unified Backend |
| 4400 | Product Service | 3000 | Unified Backend |
| 4500 | Order Service | 3000 | Unified Backend |

### Environment Variables Updated

```bash
# Old Variables (Removed)
ADMIN_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:4800
CHAT_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:4700
USER_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:4300

# New Variables (Added)
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL=ws://localhost:3000
```

### Endpoint Changes

| Old Endpoint | New Endpoint | Change |
|--------------|--------------|--------|
| `/setup/create-super-admin` | `/staff/setup/create-super-admin` | Added staff prefix |
| `/setup/verify-setup` | `/staff/setup/verify-setup` | Added staff prefix |
| `/users/admins` | `/staff` | Simplified path |
| `/auth/login` | `/staff/auth/login` | Added staff prefix |
| `/auth/logout` | `/staff/auth/logout` | Added staff prefix |
| `/auth/refresh` | `/staff/auth/refresh-token` | Added staff prefix, renamed |

### Verification Checklist

- ✅ All API setup routes point to unified backend
- ✅ All WebSocket connections point to unified backend
- ✅ All media upload routes point to unified backend
- ✅ All test/proxy routes point to unified backend
- ✅ Environment variables correctly configured
- ✅ No remaining references to old ports (except mock data amounts)
