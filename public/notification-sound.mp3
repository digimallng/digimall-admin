# Notification Sound Placeholder

This is a placeholder for a notification sound file.
You should replace this with an actual MP3 file containing a short notification sound.

Some good options for notification sounds:
- A short "ding" or "bell" sound (0.5-1 second)
- A soft "pop" or "bubble" sound
- A gentle "chime" sound

You can find free notification sounds at:

Make sure to use a sound that is:
- Short (under 2 seconds)
- Not too loud or jarring
- Pleasant and professional
- In MP3 format for browser compatibility
