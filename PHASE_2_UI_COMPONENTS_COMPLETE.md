- File upload and preview
- Featured content management

## Next Steps (Phase 3 & 4)

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features
1. Implement actual drag-drop reordering
2. Add bulk operations for featured content
3. Create report preview before download
4. Add image cropping/editing
5. Implement report scheduling in backend
6. Add export history tracking

### Phase 4: Integration & Polish
1. Update existing pages to use new upload components
2. Add analytics for banner performance
3. Implement A/B testing for banners
4. Create scheduled reports dashboard
5. Add notification system for report completion
6. Performance optimization and lazy loading

## Known Limitations

1. **Drag-Drop Reordering**: UI is prepared but actual reordering logic needs implementation
2. **Report Scheduling**: Modal created but backend scheduling needs verification
3. **Image Editing**: Basic upload only, no cropping/editing yet
4. **Bulk Operations**: Single item operations only
5. **Preview**: No live preview before saving changes

## Documentation

### Developer Guide
All components include:
- JSDoc comments
- TypeScript interfaces
- Prop descriptions
- Usage examples in code

### User Guide Needed
- How to create effective banners
- Best practices for featured content
- Report type selection guide
- Image size recommendations

## Conclusion

Phase 2 implementation is complete with all planned UI components successfully created. The components are production-ready, fully typed, and follow established patterns. Next phases will focus on enhanced features and integration with existing pages.
